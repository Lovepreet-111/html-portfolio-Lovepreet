<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a 3rd-year Information Technology student at J.C. Bose University of Science and Technology, YMCA. I'm passionate about coding, solving real-world problems, and constantly learning new technologies.
I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and I love building things using Web Development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. I also work with Python and its popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.
I enjoy diving deep into backend logic, designing clean front-ends, and participating in tech events, hackathons, and coding contests. I'm currently exploring areas like Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and API integration.
Always curious, always coding — I believe in learning by building. Whether it’s a mini project or a full-stack web app, I try to bring creativity and logic together.
Looking forward to growing as a developer and working on impactful tech projects!.</p>
